🔒 Firebase Security & API Safety

This project uses "public Firebase configuration" (as required for frontend apps). All operations are protected through:

- ✅ Authenticated access only
- 🔐 Firestore security rules (`request.auth != null`)
- 🌐 API Key domain restrictions(localhost & Netlify only)

> 💡 No private credentials are stored or exposed.
> Firebase keys are safe for frontend use when rules are properly implemented.
